Code and data for an agent based simulation to analyze the effect of various lockdown policies in India 

Population Sampling: 
To run the simulations on states of Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, you will need additional files which capture the sampled population, on which the simulation will run. Please download the pickle files for these from the following links and save them in the same directory as the rest of your code. 
- Maharashtra: https://www.dropbox.com/s/uh9vxkp5sm95avr/Maharashtra_population_10000000.pickle?dl=0
- Uttar Pradesh: https://www.dropbox.com/s/jgmlsp3v2ttzyhf/tamilnadu_population_10000000.pickle?dl=0
- Tamil Nadu: https://www.dropbox.com/s/p6ie5671zs8w1jl/up_population_10000000.pickle?dl=0
Alternatively, you can generate a population sample of your own using 'Population_Generation.ipynb'. Make sure to uncomment/comment lines in code specific to whichever state's population you wish to sample.
